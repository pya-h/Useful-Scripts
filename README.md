<h1>Useful Scripts</h1>
Here I put some useful scripts written by myself;<br/>
Scripts are written in Batch/bash or maybe both.<br/>

<hr />
<h2>cleanjunks</h2>
* It cleans the most space allocating trashes on the linux, by apps like apt, snap, vscode, android-studio, * cache and so on.<br/>
    It throws a full log of everything thats cleaned.<br/>

<hr />
<h2>gethem</h2>
* Oh and this one; <b>Say hello to my little friend 'gethem' :)))</b> <br>
* This one is a useful script, that will batch download urls you provide in a file called 'list.txt' near the script location,<br/>
    Then it creates a download queue and does the rest. <br/>
* No need to search for third party download apps for linux, this simple script does what's necessary.<br/> 
* It also accepts arguments to clear or add URLs to the queue.

<hr />
<h2>auth-gh-deploy</h2>
* It gets the frontend built resources, then pushes it to its repository gh-pages branch, <br />
      so you can have a live demo for that frontend, tested for React, Angular and classic html/css/js.<br/>
      It gets the resource directory location, repository name and your username and password and does the rest.<br/>
* NOTICE: This one is a windows BAT script though, so runs on windows not linux.

<hr />
<h1> TODO </h1>
* <b>gethem.sh</b>: Make the input file interactive, so if the user adds to the list while gethem is downloading, it updates the data.<br/>
* <b>cleanjunks.sh</b>: Search for word 'cache' and remove the result; (a little risky)
<hr />
