# gh-pages Deploy Script

I wrote this script to overcome some problems that will happen when trying to use gh-apges package in react or angular or etc.

* Just provide user git username and reponame, and the project built folder, and this script will do the rest.

* I wrote powershell scipt for now, but soon I will add linux bash script too.
