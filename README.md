# Useful Scripts
Here I put some useful scripts written by myself;
Scripts are written in Batch/bash or maybe both.

<hr />
# cleanjunks
    x It cleans the most space allocating trashes on the linux, by apps like apt, snap, vscode, android-studio, linux cache and so on.
    It throws a full log of everything thats cleaned.

<hr />
# gethem
    x Oh and this one; `Say hello to my little friend 'gethem' :)))`
    This one is a useful script, that will batch download urls you provide in a file called 'list.txt' near the script location,
    This it creates a download queue and does the rest. 
    x No need to search for third party download apps for linux, this simple script does what's necessary. 

<hr />
# auth-gh-deploy
    x It gets the frontend built resources, then pushes it to its repository gh-pages branch,
      so you can have a live demo for that frontend, tested for React, Angular and classic html/css/js.
      It gets the resource directory location, repository name and your username and password and does the rest.
    X NOTICE: This one is a windows BAT script though, so runs on windows not linux.

<hr />
# TODO:
* gethem.sh: Make the input file interactive, so if the user adds to the list while gethem is downloading, it updates the data.
* cleanjunks.sh: Search for word 'cache' and remove the result; (a little risky)
<hr />
