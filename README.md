# Useful Scripts
Here I put some useful scripts written by myself;
Scripts are written in Batch/bash or maybe both.

# cleanjunks
    x It cleans the most space allocating trashes on the linux, by apps like apt, snap, vscode, android-studio, linux cache and so on.
    It throws a full log of everything thats cleaned.

# gethem
    x Oh and this one; `Say hello to my little friend 'gethem' :)))`
    This one is a useful script, that will batch download urls you provide in a file called 'list.txt' near the script location,
    This it creates a download queue and does the rest. 
    x The input file is interactive, meaning you can update and add/remove urls even while the script is running and downloading.
    No need to look for third party download apps, this simple script does what's necessary. 
# auth-gh-deploy
    x It gets the frontend built resources, then pushes it to its repository gh-pages branch,
      so you can have a live demo for that frontend, tested for React, Angular and classic html/css/js.
      It gets the resource directory location, repository name and your username and password and does the rest.
